These are support files for a tutorial held in September 2023 at the summer school [Design and Control of Microbial Communities](http://msysbiology.com/microbedesign/) at KU Leuven, Belgium.
The tutorial describes metabolic network reconstruction and simulation with dynamic FBA for a community of yeast with acetic acid bacteria.

## Tutorial materials

The repository contains two Jupyter notebook:
- ``part1_reconstruction.ipynb`` covers the metabolic network reconstruction part.
- ``part2_community_dfba.ipynb`` covers the dynamic FBA simulation part.

## Working with Jupyter notebooks

The best way to participate in the tutorial is to work on the provided Jupyter notebooks in Google Colaboratory: [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).

You will need to be logged in with a Google / Gmail account to open any notebooks in Colaboratory.

Alternatively, the Jupyter notebooks can be run in a local Python environment. It is recommmended to use the [conda package manager](https://conda.io).
The file environment.yml provided with the tutorial materials can be used to set up the required packages as explained here:

## FBA model reconstruction on modelseed.org

To run an automated FBA model reconstruction on modelseed.org, an account on that platform will be needed. You can create one by going to https://modelseed.org, and click the link "Create new account" under the login field.
