    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you are using the platform https://modelseed.org to perform a metabolic network reconstruction of *Acetobacter aceti*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall you should follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtaining gene sequence data from a database\n",
    "2. Identify genes with a metabolic function\n",
    "3. Perform automatic model reconstruction on https://modelseed.org\n",
    "4. Check gene assignments in the automatic reconstruction\n",
    "5. Evalution of the FBA solution\n",

    "## Obtaining gene sequence data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you are constructing a metabolic network model for the gram negative bacterium *Acetobacter aceti*, which is used in the food industry to procude vinegar from alcohol.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the gene sequence available at the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) under the identifier 435.5 (Acetobacter aceti strain TMW2.1153).\n",
    "You can obtain the sequence information from the database by the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to [www.bv-brc.org](https://www.bv-brc.org/).\n",
    "- Enter the strain name in the search field, and click on the returned Genome match which should have the ID 435.5.\n",
    "- Press the button labelled \"Download\" in the right margin, tick \"Protein Sequences in FASTA (*.faa)\" in the popup window, and press \"Download\".\n",
    "- The downloaded zip file will contain a file called \"435.5.PATRIC.faa\"; that is the one we need to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following code examples to work completely, you should add the downloaded file with the name ``acetobacter_aceti.txt` to the working directory of this notebook.\n",
