    "# Part 2: Community simulation with dynamic FBA\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you are setting up a microbial community model and simulate it with a simplistic dynamic FBA scheme using [cobrapy](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io) for the FBA solutions and the [integrate.solve_ivp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html) function of scipy for the dynamic simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The community is a composition of yeast and an *Escherichia coli* strain that is assumed to be able to metabolize ethanol if oxygen is available. This *E. coli* model is meant as a substitute for *Acetobacter aceti* for which we don't have a suitable curated metabolic network reconstruction.\n",

    "* *E. coli*: http://bigg.ucsd.edu/models/iECW_1372\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume initially aerobic conditions, however, oxygen transfer is assumed to be slow and will become limiting at high metabolic activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the two models will be downloaded an analysed individually with FBA to get a first idea of the relevant exchange constraints and fluxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, dynamic FBA models for each species individually will be simulated.\n",

    "Finally, you will combine the two DFBA models into a single community model and simulate that.\n",
